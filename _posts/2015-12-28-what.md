# **What?**

eyeBot, LLC is an angel-invested startup that is building technology-based solutions for the visually impaired, or VI, users. For starters, we are focused on enabling VI users to remotely explore an area of choice (e.g., Denver Downtown, airports), and navigate via accessibility-enabled walking directions. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d9f42870-21d3-4c5f-8c5c-2c52baa97059.png)
